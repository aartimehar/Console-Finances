## Description

I have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses. My task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

- The total number of months included in the dataset.
- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- Total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
